### Installation Instructions
To set up the Auto Assembly Line project, first, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Open VS Code or your preferred terminal and run the command git clone <repository-url>, replacing <repository-url> with the actual repository link. Once the cloning process is complete, navigate into the project directory by running cd <project-folder>, replacing <project-folder> with the appropriate directory name. Next, install the necessary dependencies by running npm install. This command will download and install all required Node.js packages. After the installation is complete, you can start the project by running npm start. If the project uses a different entry file, you may need to run node main.js instead.

### Intended Usage
The Auto Assembly Line project is designed to simulate an automated manufacturing process in a terminal environment using Node.js and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It allows users to define different components, assemble them into finished products, and track the production process programmatically.

### Contributing Guidelines
Before making any changes, create a new branch using git checkout -b feature-branch, replacing feature-branch with a descriptive name related to your contribution. Once on your new branch, make your modifications while following the project's coding style and best practices. Ensure your changes do not break existing functionality and use clear and concise commit messages.

### Test Instructions
Before submitting your changes, thoroughly test the application by running npm test to confirm that all tests pass. Once youâ€™re confident in your changes, commit them using git add . followed by git commit -m "Brief description of your changes", and push them to your forked repository with git push origin feature-branch
